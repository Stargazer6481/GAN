# **GAN – Game Answer Network**  
*A tiny, chaotic, heavily vibe-coded trivia game powered by OpenTDB categories.*

## ⭐️ What is This?
GAN is a lightweight real-time multiplayer trivia game built with:

- **Node.js**
- **Express**
- **Socket.IO**
- **OpenTDB** (for categories & questions)
- **QR Code join system**
- **Point scoring based on answer speed**
- **Countdown timer per question**

This was a **small little project that was heavily vibe-coded** — not meant to be fancy, but it’s fun, fast, and actually works.
